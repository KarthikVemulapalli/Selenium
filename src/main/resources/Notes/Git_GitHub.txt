Git SetUp through Eclipse
	Step1: Create a local repository in System
	Step2: 'Add' code to Staging Area
	Step3: 'Commit' code to Local Repository
	Step4: Create a repository in Remote Server and get the project link
	Step5: 'Push' code to Remote Repository (GitHub)


Git (Distributed Version Control System) Importance & SetUp through Command Prompt
	* Add is from 'WorkingArea' to 'StagingArea'
	* Commit is from 'StagingArea' to 'LocalRepository'
	* Push is from 'LocalRepository' to 'RemoteRepository'.
	* Pull is from 'RemoteRepository' to 'WorkingArea'.
	* Basic git commands 'https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html'
	* Advanced git commands 'https://www.atlassian.com/git/glossary'

	Initial Push Project code to Github remote repository,
		1.First Introduce Yourself to Git,
			git config --global user.name "Karthik"
			git config --global user.email "vemulapalli.karthik@gmail.com"	
		2.Navigate to the folder structure in Command Prompt, where project is present.
		3.Initialize git file in the path using 
			git init
		4.Add code to 'Staging Area'.
			git add * {* represents all files}
		5.Commit the code present in Staging area. We can only commit the code that is present in 'Staging Area'.
			git commit -m "Commit Message"
		6.Connect local repository to Remote repository, here we are adding origin using GitHubLink. So from next all changes pushed will be updated in this link repository.
			git remote add origin 'remote repository link'
		7.Push the code from local repository to remote repository master branch (default branch).
			git push origin master
	Clone project from Github,
		1.Taking the project for the first time, the below code copy the complete code to the directory where you required.
			git clone RemoteRepositoryLink
	Check the status of the project
		1.Basically it displays the changes you have made. The changes will be shown in Green, if code is added to 'Staging Area'. If not it displays in Red.
			git status
	Change the origin link from one repository to another
			git remote set-url origin NewRemoteRepositoryLink
	Get the current origin value of GitHub url in which the project is pointing. This gives all the GitHub urls pointing.
			git remote -v
	Get all the local & remote repository information
			git remote show origin
	Get the GitHub account configuration details of the project
			git config -l
	Get the global username and email
			git config --global --list
	Remove the current credentials password/token
			git config --unset credential.helper
	Get the latest code Changes in Project. 
		1.Pulls all the code from Github to local working area.
			git pull origin master
	Creating a branch to the project.
		1.New branch (develop) created so modifications will not impact master branch. This new branch will have all the code from master. '-b' is used to create new branch. 
			git checkout -b develop
		2.To check in which branch currently you are working on, it will display the branch.
			git branch
		3.To change the view from master to develop branch
			git checkout develop
	Merge develop branch to master branch
		1.First make sure you are in master branch 'active branch'
			git checkout master
		2.Now merge develop branch to active branch i.e. master
			git merge develop
	Unstage any file from StagingArea
		1.To unstage any file
			git rm --cached 'fileName'
