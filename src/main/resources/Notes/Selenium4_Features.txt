Chrome DevTools Protocol (https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/)
	* CDP provide tools to instrument, inspect, debug and profile chromium, chrome and other Blink-based browsers.
	* In Selenium 4, team has created powerful commands which are wrapper classes around CDP functions to grant access to chromium based browser DevTools directly from automated tests.
	* Chromium driver class has predefined methods to access dev tools.
	* Only Chrome & Edge drivers are inherited from Chromium driver. So, we can access DevTools only with Chrome and Edge browsers.
	* Optional Class is introduced from Java 8.
	
	** DevTools uses send(command) to interact with CDP
		devtoolsobject -> send(command) -> Selenium server Interprets Commands -> CDP -> Mimic behaviour on test browser
	** For certain CDP commands there are no custom commands available in Selenium, we can directly call CDP command,
		devtoolsobject -> executeCdpCommand(CDP) -> CDP -> Mimic behaviour on test browser

	** Provide lamba expression when ever we are dealing with Comsumer and Handler.

	Emulation:
		* setDeviceMetricsOverride: Stimulate mobile browser sizes to test using web browsers.
		* setGeolocationOverride: Acts like a VPN to the browser.
